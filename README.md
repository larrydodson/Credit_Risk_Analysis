## Overview 
  
  Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

   ### Purpose
   To employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes, such as imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, to build and evaluate models using resampling, in order to evaluate the performance of these models, and to make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
  
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
   - Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
   - Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
   - Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (this README.md)
